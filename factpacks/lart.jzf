author Alexander Boyd
scope any
description Adds a "lart" command, which chooses from one of 133 creative responses that would 
 generally not be pleasant to the person in question. For example, "~lart jcp" might respond with 
 "/me rm -rf's jcp", "/me smacks jcp upside and over the head with one freakishly huge killer 
 whale named Hugh", "/me shoves avocados down jcp's throat until jcp dies", or "/me cats 
 /dev/urandom into jcp's ear".\n
 A lot of the responses (such as the "rm -rf" one or the "/dev/urandom" one) are of a technical 
 nature, and all of them are sent as actions (IE as if they were prefixed with "/me").
