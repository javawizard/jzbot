=%SELFNICK% is an IRC bot. Use "%HELPCMD% about" for more info. Use "%HELPCMD% usinghelp" for information on how to use %SELFNICK%'s built-in help.
factoids=Factoids are the main way to control the bot and actually make it do stuff useful. They are essentially miniature programs. They can be as simple as a piece of text to send to the channel, or as complex as a game of russian roulette or mastermind. See "%HELPCMD factoids creating" for help with creating factoids.
factoids.creating=To create a factoid, ***MORE HELP COMING SOON***, ask jcp if you have questions, at irc.freenode.net, channel ##jzbot.
perms=%SELFNICK% maintains a list of "superops", and a list of "ops" at each channel. Superops are the users that can modify configuration, shut down the bot, modify global factoids, and such. Ops at a channel can modify that channel's factoids, agg regexes to the channel, change the channel's trigger, and such. All users are referred to by their hostname or hostmask.
perms.superop=Superops have permission to shutdown and reconnect the bot, modify configuration with the "config" command, redefine commands with the "redefine" command, modify global factoids, and tell the bot to join or leave channels. Superops are also counted as "ops" at all channels that the bot joins. \n\
See "%HELPCMD% perms superop add" for help on adding a new superop, "%HELPCMD% perms superop delete" for help on removing a superop, and "%HELPCMD% perms superop list" for help on listing superops.
perms.superop.add=To add a new superop, send "superop add <hostname>" to the bot, where <hostname> is the hostname or hostmask of the user you want to add as a superop. Any user with that hostname or hostmask will be a superop from then on.
perms.superop.delete=To remove an existing superop, send "superop delete <hostname>" to the bot, where <hostname> is the hostname or hostmask of the user you want to remove as a superop. The user with that hostname or hostmask will no longer be a superop.
perms.superop.list=To get a list of all current superops, send "superop list" to the bot. The bot will reply with a list of hostnames that have superop privileges. If the list is so long that the bot floods itself off of the network, send "config delay 2000" to slow down how often the bot sends messages, and then try again.
about=%SELFNICK% is an IRC bot. The software it runs is JZBot (http://jzbot.googlecode.com). JZBot uses (a slightly modified version of) PircBot (http://jibble.org/pircbot.php) as its IRC library. For other libraries that it uses, see "%HELPCMD% credits".\n\
For a list of JZBot's main developers and authors, see "%HELPCMD% authors", and for a list of JZBot's factpack writers (both direct and indirect), see "%HELPCMD% packwriters".
functions=Functions are pieces of text that you can embed within a factoid that cause it to do special stuff like use "/me" to send a message or run another factoid some time into the future. Each subpage of this page is the name of a function that you can use within a factoid.
usinghelp=To use %SELFNICK%'s built-in help, you can either send messages to the bot directly, or you can send messages at a channel that start with the bot's trigger. Either way, each help page can have a bunch of "subpages", which are help pages that describe more about the help page you're reading. For example, the "perms" help page has a subpage called "superop".\n\
To read a subpage, you use the exact same command that you used to get the parent help page, but you add a space followed by the name of the subpage onto the end of the command. For example, to read the subpage "superop" of the page "perms", you would use "%HELPCMD% perms superop".
